Online game generator
---------------------


The game generator is meant for Web deployment.  It uses html and php to
create a set of parameters from an html form, which can then be read by the
SimpleGeneratedGame class.  See website/ for the php/html code.  This program
is still in its development stages, so expect bugs, quirks and lack of
documentation!  See website/index.html for some more documentation.

SimpleGeneratedGame reads the game parameters using AppConfig.  If run as an
applet, it takes its config filename from a parameter called configfile.  If
run as an application, it opens a file selector in which you can select an
appconfig file.  Some example *.appconfig files are supplied in the examples/
directory.

From the JGame main directory, try:

  java gamegen.SimpleGeneratedGame [ <width> <height> ]
or:
  java -jar jgame-gamegen.jar [ <width> <height> ]  (if you generated the jar)
