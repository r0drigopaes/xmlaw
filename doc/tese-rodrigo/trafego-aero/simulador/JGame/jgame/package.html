<body>

Contains the essential classes of JGame.

<P>

The main classes are JGEngine (the whole game) and JGObject (a sprite object).
Sublass these to write your own game.  It's handy to have your JGObject
classes as inner classes of your JGengine.  JGTimer is used for creating
timers in your games.  ImageUtil contains some image manipulation methods that
are used by JGame but can be used stand-alone as well.  AppConfig is a
stand-alone class that can be used for game configuration.

<P>

StdGame is a game framework that handles a standard game state machine
(startlevel, life lost, game over, etc).  It is built as a layer on top of
JGEngine.  It uses AppConfig for handling keyboard settings.

<P>
JGame should also come with a user manual (the file MANUAL).  It is
distributed under the revised BSD license (see the file LICENSE).
