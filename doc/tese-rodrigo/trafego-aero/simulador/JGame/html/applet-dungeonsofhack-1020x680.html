DungeonsOfHack applet
</applet>
<p>
A Gauntlet clone with generated levels.  Pick up all the gold in each level.
<br>
Keys can be used to open doors (the brown wall segments are doors).  
<br>
Move around using the cursor keys.  Use W,S,A,D to shoot.
<br>
Use the Shift key plus a direction to open a door.
<br>
This game's levels should still be made progressively harder.
<br>
(as the difficulty level now randomly ranges from "pretty challenging" to "very
difficult").
