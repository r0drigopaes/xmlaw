\abstract{%
Morse theory has been considered a powerful tool in its applications to computational topology, computer graphics and geometric modeling. It was originally formulated for smooth manifolds. Recently, Robin Forman formulated a version of this theory for discrete structures such as cell complexes. It opens up several categories of interesting objects (particularly meshes) to applications of Morse theory.

Once a Morse function has been defined on a manifold, then information about its topology can be deduced from its critical elements. The purpose of this work is to design an algorithm to define optimal discrete Morse functions on general cell complex, where optimality entails having the least number of critical elements. This problem is proven here to be MAX--SNP hard. However, we provide a linear algorithm that, for the case of 2--manifolds, always reaches optimality.

Moreover, we proved various results on the structure of a discrete Morse function. In particular, we provide an equivalent representation by hyperforests. From this point of view, we designed a construction of discrete Morse functions for general cell complexes of arbitrary finite dimension. The resulting algorithm is quadratic in time and, although not guaranteed to be optimal, gives optimal answers in most of the practical cases.

\chapter{Future works}

This work was focused on Forman's discrete Morse theory. We analyzed the building blocs of this theory, and proved the layered structure of discrete Morse functions. We represented this layer structure by a collection of hyperforests and gave a complete characterization of the critical cells in terms of regular components of hyperforests. We used this analysis to introduce a scheme for constructing discrete Morse function on finite cell complexes of arbitrary dimension. This construction is quadratic in time in the worst cases, and is proven to be linear and optimal in the case of 2-manifolds. The experimental results showed our algorithm gave an optimal result in most of the cases. This opens the question of which conditions on the cell complex would ensure the optimality of the resulting function.

An important application of this work to computer graphics would be in the field of geometric compression. The algorithm Grow\&Fold of A. Szymczak and J. Rossignac \cite{Szy00} could be justified and enhanced by our algorithm to minimize the number of so-called ``glue faces'' in order to achieve a better encoding. This work has been done in an optimal way for the case of surfaces with handles in \cite{Lop02}.

We plan to continue this work in three directions. First, as mentioned above, apply Forman's theory and the analysis of our algorithm for solid mesh compression. Second, we will try to apply discrete Morse theory to resolve singularities that arise from shape reconstruction. Finally, we look forward to produce a topologically consistent morphing based on mapping directly the discrete gradient field between two objects of the same homotopy type.
