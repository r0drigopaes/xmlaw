  abstract = {Experimentation helps determine the effectiveness of proposed
     theories and methods. But computer science has not developed a concise
     taxonomy of methods that could be used to demonstrate the validity of
     new software development techniques. Partly as a result of this,
     the state of experimentation in software engineering is poor. In
     this article, the authors describe the four general approaches to
     experimentation and the important aspects of data collection. They propose a
     taxonomy for software engineering experimentation that describes
     12 different experimental approaches. To underscore the need for
     experimentation, the authors also analyze 612 papers in software engineering
     published in 1985, 1990, and 1995. They classified each paper according
     to the data collection method used to validate the claims in the
     paper. They found that about a third of the papers had no experimental
     validation, and many authors used sloppy terminology to describe their
     validation method. The software engineering community, the authors
     conclude, can do a better job reporting its results. This, in turn,
     will help industry select the right new technology to implement. },

  title = {A Framework for Software Project Metrics},
  booktitle = {12th ESCOM Conference on Software Control and Metrics},
  year = {2001},
  abstract = {Software Engineering is a discipline which is making exceptional progress in the
     development of new paradigms, methods, tools and techniques for the
     production of information systems. A weakness is that the academic
     development of the theory underlying these advances is often “out of
     synchronisation” with current usage. The use of metrics is a key factor in the
     establishment of a scientific basis for Software Engineering and the
     reduction of the gap between academics and practitioners. Systematic
     measurement is necessary for the formal modelling and evaluation of the
     new techniques and their optimal use within industry. A number of
     approaches (e.g. the Software Factory, CMM, Bootstrap, SPICE, GQM,
     Balanced Scorecard), have been advocated for the systematic design
     and introduction of software metrics for the purposes of process
     improvement and capability assessment in an organisation. This paper
     defines a taxonomy of software metrics which is derived from the
     needs of users, developers and management. The properties of the
     classifications are discussed. Rules are then derived which generate
     a new set of metrics from an existing class. The rules complement
     standard approaches by focusing attention on user driven aspects of an
     organisation's measurement programme. They do this by directly linking product
     characteristics with organisational improvements. The method also has
     promise as an approach for validating process models and metrics.
     Examples of the theoretical and pragmatic use of the taxonomy are
     provided. The paper concludes with a discussion of useful applications.},

  abstract = {Continuous collection and analysis of measurement data is crucial in tracking and
     managing a software development process efficiently. However, practice
     has shown that setting up and carrying out a measurement programme
     requires a lot of effort. Despite their tight schedules project managers
     and project personnel perform measurement activities in addition
     to their main daily duties. Furthermore, measurement tasks may be
     perceived as secondary work for a software development project, which as
     such may harm the success of the measurement programme. Thus, all
     measurement activities that are reasonable to automate should be
     automated. In this paper we propose a measurement automation process that
     is based on the principles of goal-driven measurement. We give two
     industrial examples to demonstrate what measurement automation means in
     practice. We also discuss tool requirements and as an example, we present
     a measurement management tool enhanced by measurement automation},

  abstract = {Cooperative Software Engineering (CSE) means that large-scale, software development
     and maintenance can be conducted in a distributed organisation or
     across organisations. CSE can be characterised by distributed process
     fragments, partly shared workspaces, cooperation planning, and frequent
     interactions in intra/inter-workspaces. To support CSE processes, we
     must deal with dynamic, unpredictable processes as well as stable,
     repeatable processes with totally different characteristics. Traditional
     workflow and process systems offer good support for stable, pre-planned
     processes, providing user agendas, invocation of tools, presentation of
     process state etc. Multi-agent systems are well suited to model and
     support users involved in cooperative processes. By combining these two
     technologies, processes with characteristics similar to cooperative software
     engineering processes can be modelled and supported more completely. The
     thesis presents a framework called CAGIS Process Centred Environment
     (PCE), for combining a workflow system with a multi-agent system.},
